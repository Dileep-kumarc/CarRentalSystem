# CarRentalSystem
Car Rental System in Java ðŸš—

A Java console-based application that simulates a Car Rental System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding. Users can enter the number of rental days and calculate the total rent dynamically for each vehicle.

Features

Inheritance: Car class inherits from Vehicle to reuse common attributes like carName, carModel, and pricePerDay.

Dynamic Rent Calculation: Calculates total rent based on user input for rental days.

Encapsulation: Class fields are properly managed for secure and structured data.

Polymorphism: Overridden displayInfo() method displays car details and total rent.

User-Friendly Console Output: Clear display of car name, model, seats, price per day, and total rent.

Scalable Design: Easy to extend with new vehicle types (bikes, trucks, etc.).

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/Dileep-kumarc/CarRentalSystem.git]


Open the project in your Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans, etc.).

Run the CarRental.java file.

Enter the number of rental days when prompted.

View the rent and vehicle details in the console output.
